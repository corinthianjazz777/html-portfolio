<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Music Teacher / Programming Student</h2>
<h3>MUSIC TEACHING </h3>
<p>I studied classical piano as a child and contemporary keyboard and guitar in my youth. 
  After playing guitar in a variety of live situations, I studied music theory and performance at School of Creative Arts In Sydney, Australia. 
  I started teaching both guitar and piano in 2007, then in 2022 I taught a class in ukulele. 
  I also write music and enjoy teaching from the perspective of the theory and form of the different musical genres - 
  classical, folk, country, pop, jazz, gospel, and blues. 
  I have taught children and adult from ages 4 through 64, and enjoy the challenge of finding each student's point of creative flow. </p>

  <h3>PROGRAMMING </h3>
<p>In my years working in the radio industry, my first coding experience was with the Commodore 64, writing a program in Basic Language for the station I was working for then. 
  A simple data entry program to collect the song requests each night, then perform simple computations to display and store the percentage difference between each song's values of: 
  times requested, male/female, and age. 
  These were then measured against the current rotation where that song existed in the on air playlist. 
  After leaving the radio industry, I studied Java at the Hunter Institute of Technology, through the Java Programming book by Joyce Farrell. 
  Some years later while teaching music, I decided to chase the roots of Java & discovered an online course by Chuck Allison, Thinking In C. 
  His description was to prepare students for either Java or C++. 
  I started doing my own small projects in C++, while still maintaining an interest in the C language. 
  I continue to self-study C through books and online courses. 
  I have just enrolled in an online course for Full Stack Web Development. </p>

<p>I enjoy writing code and imagine myself in a backend position, however I realise all experience is valuable and look forward to the opportunity to get a start in the industry. 
  I have a great attention to detail and enjoy the process of thinking through the most efficient way to write code for a given task. 
  I would love to be in an environment where I can learn from more experienced programmers and develop my skills. </p>
